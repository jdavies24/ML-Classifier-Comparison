# ML-Classifier-Comparison
# Machine Learning Classifier Comparison

This code compares different machine learning classifiers using a predefined list of classifiers and evaluates their performance on a given dataset. The code measures various metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices, training score, cross-validation score, and elapsed time for each classifier. It also checks for overfitting by comparing the training score and cross-validation score.

## Classifiers

The following classifiers are included in the comparison:

- Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM)
- Polynomial Support Vector Machine (Polynomial SVM)
- Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF SVM)
- Gaussian Process
- Gradient Boosting
- Decision Tree
- Extra Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (Neural Net)
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Usage

1. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed (`random`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `time`).
2. Set the desired random seed value for reproducibility.
3. Define your dataset (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`) before running the code.
4. Run the code to compare the classifiers on the dataset.
5. The code will output various performance metrics for each classifier, including accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices, training score, cross-validation score, and elapsed time.

## Hyperparameters

All classifiers in this code are initialized with their standard hyperparameter values. It is recommended to adjust the hyperparameters based on your specific dataset and requirements for optimal performance.

## Results

The code generates the following metrics for each classifier:

- Accuracy: The accuracy of the classifier on the test dataset.
- Recall: The recall score of the classifier on the test dataset.
- Precision: The precision score of the classifier on the test dataset.
- F1 score: The F1 score of the classifier on the test dataset.
- Confusion matrix: The confusion matrix of the classifier on the test dataset.
- Training score: The accuracy of the classifier on the training dataset.
- Cross-validation score: The average accuracy of the classifier on the cross-validation folds.
- Elapsed time: The time taken by the classifier to train and make predictions.

## Checking for Overfitting

To check for overfitting, compare the training score with the cross-validation score. If the training score is significantly higher than the cross-validation score, it indicates potential overfitting.
